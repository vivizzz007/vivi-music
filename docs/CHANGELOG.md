# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-26

### 🚀 Modernization & Quality Hardening

This release focuses on hardening the application infrastructure, modernizing the architecture for scalability, and establishing strict quality governance.

### ✨ Key Changes

#### 🏗 Architecture & Infrastructure
- **MusicService Hardening**: Completely refactored `MusicService` to eliminate concurrency leaks. Switched to `SupervisorJob` for structured concurrency and implemented robust lifecycle cleanup for BroadcastReceivers and MediaSession resources.
- **Single File Components (SFC)**: Migrated core screens (`SettingsScreen`, `LibraryScreen`, `ChangelogScreen`) to the Single File Component pattern. This improves maintainability by co-locating UI, Logic, and Previews.
- **Project Governance**: Established strict coding standards with a new "Iron-Clad" `.editorconfig` (Google/Android 16 standards) and configured `Ktlint`.

#### ⚡ Performance
- **Image Loading Optimization**: Optimized `Coil` configuration in `App.kt` by enabling `crossfade` for smoother transitions and explicitly configuring memory caching (25% of available memory).
- **Efficiency Audit**: Verified `LibraryScreen` recomposition behavior, ensuring `LazyColumn` and `LazyVerticalGrid` utilize stable keys and immutable entities for maximum scrolling performance.

#### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **TDD Integration**: Implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflows.
  - Added unit tests for `LibraryViewModel` achieving 100% coverage.
  - Added unit tests for `IntegrationsViewModel` using `Turbine` for Flow testing and `MockK` for isolation.
- **Code Coverage**: Integrated `Kover` for code coverage reporting, setting a baseline goal of 80% for business logic.

#### 📚 Documentation
- **New Documentation Suite**: Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/`:
  - `Technical_Manual.md`: Deep dive into architecture and tech stack.
  - `governance.md`: Coding standards and rules.
  - `tdd_quality_blueprint.md`: Testing strategy and workflows.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for new contributors.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Resource Duplication**: Resolved "Duplicate Resources" build errors by merging and cleaning up `vivi_strings.xml`.
- **Memory Leaks**: Fixed potential memory leaks in `MusicService` related to improper CoroutineScope cancellation.

### 🧹 Cleanup
- Removed legacy string resources and unused files.
- Refactored `NewsDetailScreen` to match the new architecture standards.
