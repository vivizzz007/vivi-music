 * https://github.com/Kyant0/backdrop — Copyright 2025 Kyant0, Apache License 2.0
 *
 * Vendored so the library ships as source with this app (binary AARs compiled
 * against older Compose broke at runtime) and to add a backdrop resolution
 * scale for cheaper effect rendering. KMP expect/actual declarations were
 * merged into this single Android source set. Package renamed accordingly.
