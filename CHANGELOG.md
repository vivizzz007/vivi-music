# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Desktop-specific changes are marked with `[DE]` (e.g. `- [DE] New desktop
feature.`). Desktop releases use a combined version `<mobile>_DE-<desktop>`
(e.g. `6.0.5_DE-1.0.0`), where the desktop part is the program's own SemVer.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- [DE] Made `gradlew` executable in the repository and in the desktop build
  workflows (fixes `./gradlew: Permission denied` on Linux/macOS runners).
- [DE] Replaced the retired `macos-13` runner with `macos-15-intel` for the
  Intel macOS build.

### Changed

- Desktop releases now use a combined `<mobile>_DE-<desktop>` version
  (e.g. `6.0.5_DE-1.0.0`): `version.txt` line 1 = mobile version, line 2 = DE
  version, line 3 = channel. The About screen shows the full version + channel;
  desktop changelog entries are marked `[DE]`.
- The release channel is now read from line 3 of `version.txt`: `stable` (or
  empty) publishes a stable release; any other value (`rc`/`beta`/`alpha`/
  `nightly`) publishes a pre-release.
- [DE] The desktop UI is now English-first with a 49-language picker (first
  launch + Language menu); non-English strings fall back to English until
  translated.
- Release tags no longer carry a `v` prefix; non-stable releases append the
  channel to the tag (e.g. `6.0.5_DE-1.0.0-nightly`).
- [DE] The Windows installer now performs a machine-wide install into
  `C:\Program Files\VIVIMusic` (requires admin rights) instead of a per-user
  install into `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
- [DE] The Windows installer is now a branded Inno Setup wizard and shows a
  "successfully uninstalled" confirmation message after removal.

## [6.0.5] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- [DE] Compose Multiplatform desktop target (`desktop` module) reusing the
  pure-JVM network modules.
- [DE] Native desktop icons (Windows `.ico`, macOS `.icns`, Linux `.png`).
- [DE] Per-OS GitHub Actions builds (MSI/EXE, DEB/AppImage, DMG/PKG) and an
  auto-release workflow.
- [DE] Cross-device sync foundation: shared `sync` module, Node.js WebSocket
  relay (`sync-server/`), Android `DeviceSyncManager`, and desktop pairing UI.

### Changed

- Converted `innertube`, `spotify`, `lastfm`, `kizzy`, `shazamkit`,
  `jiosaavn`, and `lyricsProvider` to pure-JVM Kotlin modules so they can be
  shared between Android and desktop.

### Security

- Cross-device sync traffic is currently TLS-only; end-to-end encryption is
  planned for a future release.
